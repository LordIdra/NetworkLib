To run dnn_panel_handwriting.py:
1) download the training and test set from https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/
2) drop the training and tests sets into NetworkLib/Datasets
3) run dnn_panel_handwriting.py using CPython, pypy or another interpreter compatible with tkinter
4) use the save/load function on the control panel that appears once the program finishes importing the datasets to load
   (without quotes or .txt) 'handwriting_3'. This will load a pretrained set of weights into the algorithm which can achieve around 
   80% accuracy (yes, awful, I know, but it's the best I could do with my computer and the program's efficiency). Alternatively
   of course you can train it yourself.
