To run dnn_panel_handwriting.py:
1) download the training and test set from https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/
2) drop the training and tests sets into NetworkLib/Datasets
3) run dnn_panel_handwriting.py using CPython, pypy or another interpreter compatible with tkinter
5) press 'ADD LAYER' twice  on the control panel that appears once the program finishes importing the datasets. This
   will add two layers to the weight and node lists - which will allow you to import the weights in the next step.
4) use the save/load function to load (without quotes or .txt) 'handwriting_3'. This will load a pretrained set of 
   weights into the algorithm which can achieve around 80% accuracy (yes, awful, I know, but it's the best I could
   do with my computer and the program's efficiency). Alternatively of course you can train it yourself.
